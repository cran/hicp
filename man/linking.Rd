\title{Linking-in new index series}

\author{Sebastian Weinand}

\description{
Function \code{link()} links a new index series to an existing one by an overlap period supplied. In the resulting linked index series, the new index series starts after the existing one. Function \code{lsf()} computes the level-shift factors for linking via the overlap periods in \code{t.overlap}. The level-shift factors can be applied to an index series that has already been linked by the standard HICP one-month overlap method using December of year \code{t-1}.}

\usage{
link(x, x.new, t, t.overlap=NULL)

lsf(x, x.new, t, t.overlap=NULL)
}

\arguments{
  \item{x, x.new}{numeric vector of index values. \code{NA}-values in the vectors indicate when the index series discontinues (for \code{x}) or starts (for \code{x.new}).}
  \item{t}{date vector}
  \item{t.overlap}{character specifying the overlap period to be used. Could be a whole year (\code{YYYY}) or a single year-month (\code{YYYY-MM}). Multiple periods can be provided. If \code{NULL}, all available overlap periods are considered.}
}

\value{
Function \code{link()} returns a numeric vector of the same length as \code{t}, while \code{lsf()} provides a numeric vector of the same length as \code{t.overlap}.
